      "review": "Amangani sits above the Snake River valley with Grand Teton views that make the $180 entry feel like a reasonable trade. The heated outdoor pool in winter is one of the defining spa experiences in the American West — you're floating in hot water while the Tetons sit across the valley in snow. There is nothing else like it.",
