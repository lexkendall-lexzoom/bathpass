      "review": "The seawater infinity pool overlooking the Atlantic Ocean at Gurney's Montauk is the kind of thing people build their weekend plans around. The spa uses Atlantic seawater in its thermal circuits — genuinely mineral-rich, genuinely unusual. The full Gurney's day is one of the better arguments for leaving the city.",
