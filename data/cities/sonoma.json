      "review": "The only cedar enzyme bath in the United States, and that alone is reason to drive to Freestone. You're buried in fragrant cedar, rice bran, and plant enzymes that generate their own heat as they ferment around you. The Japanese garden meditation that follows is not optional. One of the most unique wellness experiences in the country.",
